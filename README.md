## Sharing Your Plugin

At times, a plugin you develop might be for your own specific use-case. However, the true power of Webcrumbs lies in the collective contributions of our vibrant community‚Äîour Crumblers! If you're considering sharing your plugin, one essential step is to select a license.

Choosing a license clarifies the terms under which others can use or modify your code. To ensure seamless compatibility within the Webcrumbs ecosystem, we recommend that you choose a license compatible with the MIT License, which is what Webcrumbs itself is licensed under.

By sharing your plugin, you're not just enhancing your own project; you're contributing to a growing community of developers, designers, and all-around web enthusiasts. So go ahead, spread the crumbs!
